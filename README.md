In this trivia quiz, I want to display a list style multiple question quiz with a total of 10 questions.

When the player completes the quiz, clicking on the 'Submit' button should trigger the results to be shown.

The quiz will have a timer of 2 minutes for the quiz to be completed before the quiz is automatically submitted and the results are displayed.
